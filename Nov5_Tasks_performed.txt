Tasks performed

1. Found a tool ngrok which creates a tunnel which helps in accessing a service remotely.
Used it to send a signal remotely to turn on the camera. Free tier has limited BW and hence connection ended soon.
This ngrok can be used for remote access without the need of knowing public IP of our office.

2. I wrote a text file and uploaded it using python in built web server. I was able to view the text from my mobile using http:<IP>:<port>
After using ngrok I was able to view even through mobile data. People who are far away from office also accessed the file.

3. Created a webpage with a yes/no dialog box. My plan is to switch on the camera when yes is clicked. Have to explore further on this.

4. Edgex did not work in my laptop. There is an error of process 5432. It usually belongs to postgres, and I have already installed postgres.
I changed 5432 to 5434 but still it showed the same error- 5432 process error. I have to debug it. I will run it on jetson device and check if it works.

5. To perform remote live streaming, many websites suggested to use a cloud service. I will look if there are any other options for it.
edgex also supports rtsp streaming. 

To do

1. Spend some time to debug edgex installation in laptop.

2. Install and test edgex on jetson.

3. Look for alternative ways of streaming like rtsp, and try to access the stream from a different network (mobile data) or remotely.
